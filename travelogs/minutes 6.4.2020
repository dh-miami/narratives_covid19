Catch-up 6/4

Dieyun: finished Hydrator post on WordPress, has shared link via Slack, is looking for feedback
- unable to use Voyant this week, but once it’s back up, will pick up on Spanish corpus
	- Dieyun: WordPress post is a tutorial on how to work with Voyant, no work on English corpus yet, but has worked on Spanish corpus

Gimena: task this week was to work with Marisol, will probably finish post next week due to Voyant being down
	- also we should probably stagger posts rather than all at once
	- could create a rotating schedule of posts, one person per week
	- also missing is the Spanish plugin for the site, so that English posts can be automatically translated

Matt: spent time with Voyant last week to learn the site, but the site is now down so that can’t continue yet

Romina: worked in Spanish and Argentina, added a lot to the GitHub, work in Voyant, a little exploration in Colombia, Argentina, U.S.
	- 

Susanna: had meeting with UM library today. Cameron unsure whether we can release the entire corpus, but will let us know next week
	- Gimena: is in contact with copyright librarians, will connect
	- 
Ashley: will ask Kyle (partner) about Spanish plugin for WordPress

Jerry: Jupyter notebook 
- new visualization called “bar chart race” to show rising cases between countries
- added bar chart rase for top bigrams and trigrams for after the cases in US surpassed a million (English, Florida)
	- popular tags: “may day” and “deceived world”
- also top users
	- findings: news channels/orgs are popular
- frequency analysis of top English words as well
- tried for Spanish but needs to consult--too many stop words
- goal to have Jupyter running on the server

Susanna: wait til next week to see what Luis has installed and then perhaps have a session on how to run the notebooks on the server
	- no other update for this week, but meeting next week with Cameron et al

Jerry: would be helpful to know what the DH motivations are, as right now we’re a little siloed 
	- would be good for CS part to be informed by humanities part of project

Susanna: article on digital narratives in Twitter (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1461444817745018)

Gimena: we don’t have to write all the posts right now, but maybe take a week and talk about the materials we’ve been working with, and jump to Jerry’s suggestion regarding context, and see what we can write in a more collaborative manner
	- create a calendar on Asana

Susanna: let’s stay within the first week of tweets (April 24-May1) and see what we get. Reconvene next week to give the Voyant folks time to catch up, and try to approach from an exploratory way
	- check journals, check to see what is going on
	- Jerry: pull most frequent words, bigrams, trigrams for each area for first week (4/24-5/1), txt file for each, store on GitHub


Gimena: link to similar project in Hungary (https://avobmat.hu/covid-19/)
	- should reach out to see what they’re doing/how
