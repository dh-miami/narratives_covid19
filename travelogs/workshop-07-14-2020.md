# digital narratives of COVID-19 workshop: 7/14/2020

Jerry Bonnell, j.bonnell@miami.edu

This is a workshop, not a lecture; please feel free to interrupt whenever!
The more discussion, the better :-)

## Agenda

1. Anaconda and jupyter notebooks
2. Binder
3. Brief update of Jerry's work
4. Explorations with ngrams using jupyter notebook (top_ngrams.ipynb)
5. Methods for collaboration: servers, jupyter in the cloud

## 1. Anaconda and jupyter notebooks

* Anaconda: data science toolkit
    - https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
    - versatile tool: install data science tools, packages, and software (e.g., Python, R)
        - compare with `pip`, *exclusively* a Python package manager
        - conda can be used to install pip: `conda install pip`
        - there may be packages not available as conda, but are available
          as pip ðŸ¤¯ makes sense to use both together
        - command-line enthusiasts will use pip for everything (e.g., jerry)
    - `jupyter` is a package that ships with Anaconda
        - project jupyter: https://jupyter.org/index.html
        - allows for interactive computing environments called *notebooks*
          (we'll play with one very soon!)
        - ðŸ”¥: hosted notebooks on the cloud (part 6)
        - anaconda != jupyter

## 2. Binder

* Installing anaconda and python packages is too much work
* Solution? hosted notebooks on the cloud
    -  we'll chat about it in part 6 :-)
    -  for this workshop, we'll use one option: Binder
        - https://mybinder.org
        - GitHub repository --> executable environment
        - free, zero-install needed! just follow the link and go:
            - https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dh-miami/narratives_covid19/master
        - catch? limited CPU and memory (2GB)
        - __beware__: notebooks will reset if you go above capacity or leave your computer for > 10 minutes

## 3. Brief update of Jerry's work

* (1) transform queried data to a useful format
    - use `pandas` to dump a CSV file --> "query CSV"  (thanks @Jesus!)
    - simple format, just read in with your favorite tool: Excel, Numbers, R, `pandas`
    - customizable stopwords list; put in as many files as you like

| date       | lang | geo | text                                               | hashtags     |
|------------|------|-----|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|

| 2020-05-14 | es   | co  | colombia supera 13000 casos nuevo reporte minsalud |              |

* (2) take this query CSV and apply basic NLP tasks, taking into account location-language pairs (fl-es, fl-en, es-es, etc..); also output another CSV --> "NLP CSV"
    - uni-grams (word frequency), bi-grams, tri-grams
    - top hashtags
    - top users __(not ready yet)__
    - concordance views (only in notebook)
    - unique words (only in notebook)

```

```

* (1) + (2) wrapped up into one Python tool, `coveet`
    * https://github.com/dh-miami/narratives_covid19/tree/master/scripts/freq_analysis
    * Discuss arguments available

* Prepare two jupyter notebooks on use + visualization
    - top_ngrams.ipynb (bar chart matrix)
    - freq_viz_race.ipynb (bar chart race)
    - `*` in the notebook means that the script is still working
* I suggest interactions with `coveet` to be done through the notebook, not command-line (will show how to next)

## 4. Explorations with ngrams using jupyter

* We'll hop over to `top_ngrams.ipynb` (also `freq_viz_race.ipynb`, time permitting)
    - To Binder! ðŸš€

## 5. Methods for collaboration: servers, jupyter in the cloud

## jupyter solutions

| option         | description
|----------------|--------------
| __notebook__   | single-user experience; run it on your local computer; permanent environment
| __JupyterHub__ | power of notebooks to groups of users over the cloud; no installation or maintenace needed; ideal for data science teams; permanent environment
| Binder         | hosted notebooks; temporary environment; saw this today
| ~~BinderHub~~      | ~~allows admins to deploy their own Binder environment (not a solution for us)~~

### Servers

| option        | Status    | power                         | problems
|---------------|-----------|-------------------------------|---------------
| don't use one | ready     | N/A                           | too much work, people have their own configurations, problems installing packages, OS issues, difficulty collaborating
| UMiami server | ready     | 4 cores, 32GB memory (fixed)  | fixed storage, not for public (need VPN, SSH tunneling)
| Droplet       | ready     | 1 core, 1GB memory (scalable) | limited memory, storage

Thank you!
