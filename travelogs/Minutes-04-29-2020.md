# Meeting April 29th, 2020

Participants: Gimena, Susanna, Dieyun, Jerry, Mitsu, Romina, Nidia, Ashley, Matt

## Twitter team 
* The Twitter team decides to work with three datasets already in place. Ashley takes care of finishing the information for columns (Chen Ferrara, PanaceaLab, and Kerchner-Wrubel). 
* A database is on its way that will store the tweets from the external datasets.
* We need to finish the list of hashtags and keywords in order to start creating our own dataset. The Criteria are in <https://github.com/dh-miami/narratives_covid19/blob/master/twitter-corpus/criteria.md>, and everyone can participate. 

## DOAJ 
Matt suggests to re-define the corpus and the research questions, and asks if the digital narratives will converge at some point?

## Teaching 
Marisol will add some hashtags in the Criteria file to be included in our own corpus. 

Remember to populate with new links the [Resources section in GitHub](https://github.com/dh-miami/narratives_covid19/blob/master/resources/general_resources.md).

Next meeting in 2 weeks.
