## 1. A project description, purpose, and its contribution toward the public interest (1-2 pages)
###### a. description
1) emphasize the interdisciplinarity of the project that encompasses scholars from liguistics, history, literure, computer science, digital humanities;
2) highlight our team diversity--female leadership, POC, various time zones and disciplines;
3) be upfront about the current focus on Covid-19, and frame our intention as to use the grant to add a historical perspective to deepen our understanding of current polices, discourses, and, in particular, the gender, racial, and power dynamics/injustice as the grant highlights; 
###### b. purpose
to be discussed after setting the scope
###### c. contribution to public interest 
to be discussed after setting the scope
## 2. A plan of execution, including deliverables, partners, and expected outcomes (1-2 pages)
###### a. Potential deliverables
1) a series of blog posts (including op-ed, historical narratives, scholarly review, reading and research resources) that compare and contrast our project findings to past pandemics in the Americas, or across the globe, potential topics may include:
   - How does the ways public discourse about Covid-19 racialize, genderize, and politicize the disease differ from or parallel those of historical pandemic in the Americas and the world?
   - What unique patterns can machine learning, including topic modeling, sentiment analysis and term collocations, reveal in academic discourse about Covid-19 in comparison to previous disease outbreaks? 
   - Using geographical information system (GIS) to explore the connections between historicl experiences between public health crisis and public discourse about Covid-19, i.e. how do countries and regions who have experienced major, severe disease outbreak(s) react differently to those who have not during the Covid-19 pandemic? 
   - What historical legacies of racial, gender, social (in)justice and (in)equity does the public, academic discourses about Covid-19 reveal?
   
2) a collection of action cards for a broad range of audience to take actions to promote public health justice, including educators, journalists, scholars, founding agencies, etc;

3) a interdisciplinary, collaborative syllabi to reassess public health justice through facts and fictions, history and the present.
   - perhaps a collaboration between historians, linguists, and literary studies. Comparing and contrasting fictions and historical scholarship with a combination of humanistic analysis and computational (re)interpretation to understand racial, gender, and power dynamics in public health policies and crisis in the Americas;
   - emphasize scholarships produced by POC scholars and also the experiences of marginalzed groups;
   - incorporate service learning and community advocacy (perhaps a Twitter page for community advocacy led by students);
   
4) a mapping project that visualizes project key findings, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, by location throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, and overlap with the timelines of historical public health crisis in the Americas. The purpose of this task is to produce reusable scholarly sources to inspire and assist future research projects; 
###### b. Partners 
1) UM College of Arts & Sciences
2) CONICET Argentina 
3) UM Library? 
4) UM student newspaper? 
5) UM Civic Engagement Office?
###### c. Expected outcomes
1) produce a reusable corpus of the public, academic discourses about the Covid-19 pandemic for future research;
2) explore the historical parallels, especially in racial, gender, social, and political injustice, in the Covid-19 pandemic; 
3) initiate and facilitate conversations to bridge the gap between academics and civil advociates, develop community-based advocacy plans to promote public health justice in South Florida and Buenos Aires;
4) develop a series of action cards to propose suggestions to a wide aray of community partners, including university administration, K-12 educators, journalists, NGOs and private funding agencies, local government agencies, etc.

## 3. A proposed budget (1 page)
Let's go for the max amount of $5,000 towards RA funding (250 hours, $20/hour) and/or techical maintaince of the site. 
0ther aspects that could use additional funding?
