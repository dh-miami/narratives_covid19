# Twitter Dataset and Hydratator

To be discussed April 27th, 2020 

## Apply for a Twitter developer account

Otherwise you won't be able to recover the tweets. Here is the link <https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access>. If you have already a Twitter account it won't take long.

## Hydratate 

It seems there are different tools to hydratate tweets, and that the two best known are [Hydratator](https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator) and [Twarc](https://github.com/DocNow/twarc)

We are going to use Hydrator for now because it seems easier and has a GUI. 

Follow the instructions to install it: https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator 

Also, we recommend that you follow the Lesson from the programming historian: Brad Rittenhouse, Ximin Mi, and Courtney Allen, "Beginner's Guide to Twitter Data," The Programming Historian 8 (2019), <https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/beginners-guide-to-twitter-data>
