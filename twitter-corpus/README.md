This folder will contain a corpus related to Covid-19 tweets and it will be organized as follows: 

* By Language: English, Spanish
* By Day: January 20th - 
* By geolocation: US, Latin America, Spain
* By hashtags 

We have different queries running, which correspond to the datasets in our 'twitter-corpus' folder. 

1. General query for Spanish harvesting all tweets which contain hashtags and keywords: `covid`, `coronavirus`, `pandemia`, `quarentena`, `confinamiento`, `quedateencasa`, `desescalada`, `distanciamiento social`

2. Specific query for English in Miami and South Florida. The hashtags and keywords harvested are: `covid`, `coronavirus`, `pandemic`, `quarantine`, `stayathome`, `outbreak`, `lockdown`, `socialdistancing`. 

3. Specific queries for Spanish in Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Per√∫, Ecuador, Spain, using the tweet geolocalization when possible and/or the user information.

The corpus of tweets consists of a list of Tweet Ids, that need to be treated with an "hydratator" in order to revocer all metadata. 

We started collecting our dataset on April 24th 2020. For prior dates (January - April 24th), we use the [PanaceaLab dataset](https://github.com/thepanacealab/covid19_twitter), since it is one of the few that collects data in all languages.
