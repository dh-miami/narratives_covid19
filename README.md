Digital Humanities can help us understand data from a humanistic perspective, and this seems particularly true in this time, in which data about Covid-19 seems to be everywhere and overwhelmingly generated in large volumes. Our project *Digital Narratives of Covid-19* (DHCOVID) will explore during one year (May 2020-2021) the narratives behind the data about coronavirus pandemia in academic literature and social networks using quantitative and qualitative DH approaches.

DHCOVID is a bilingual project, it focuses on data in English and Spanish, and brings togethers scholars from the University of Miami (USA) and CONICET (Argentina). However, the project is open to collaboration and co-working with researchers from Digital Humanities or any discipline interested in Covid-19 data.

In this repository we aim to collect data about the pandemic and to analyze it from a linguistic and humanistic perspective. Our main goal, in the short term, is to create a bilingual corpus in English and Spanish. 

The project has been funded by the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Miami.
